# ASPASGN1
This project is basically about the registration of students and their courses which they are going to study. There are two hyperlinks on the navigation bar one of which is Students that directs to student panel and other one is for courses.
In Students- one can register their names,grades,age and student id. In courses- same thing can be done like in students process but the difference is StudentId cannot be written by manual. It will be autofilled because it is foreign key.
Also, CRUD operations can be performed within both the pannels.
